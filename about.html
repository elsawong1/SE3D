        <h3 class="title">Who We Are</h3>
        <p>SEƐD is a student-led Register Independent Organization (RIO) at the University of Hawaii at Manoa dedicated to fostering a safe and engaging environment for individuals of all skill levels to explore 3D printing and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) disciplines. Newly established in Spring 2024, our club aims to unite students and community members in a shared passion for innovation and community service. </p>
        <h3 class="title">What We Do</h3>
        <p>Our primary focus is on 3D printing, STEAM education, and community service. We strive to provide hands-on experiences and educational opportunities in 3D printing while promoting the integration of STEAM fields into practical, real-world applications. Through workshops, projects, and collaborative events, SEƐD helps members develop their skills and make a positive impact on our local community. </p>
